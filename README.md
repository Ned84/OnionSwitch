## Description

Interface to easily switch the Tor-Exit-Node Destination Country in your Tor-Browser.
It is possible to force exit nodes to a specific country, exlude exit node countries and/or exclude countries for every Relay not only the exit relay.

Please close the Tor-Browser (if opened) before starting and using OnionSwitch

![OnionSwitch GUI](https://github.com/Ned84/OnionSwitch/blob/master/Screenshots/OnionSwitch_GUI.png)

Choose the path to your Tor-Browser (the very first folder in the Tor-Browser structure) as shown below.

![OnionSwitch TorPath](https://github.com/Ned84/OnionSwitch/blob/master/Screenshots/Choose_Tor_Path.png)

Node-Country can be chosen in the dropbox or it is possible to write the country code directly into the countrycode-box underneath the dropbox.
Only valid countrycodes work, otherwise the line will get deleted.

![OnionSwitch GUI](https://github.com/Ned84/OnionSwitch/blob/master/Screenshots/OnionSwitch_GUI2.png)

After choosing the country, its possible to add it to the torrc with clicking the button "Choose Node" or "Blacklist" respectively.

![OnionSwitch GUI](https://github.com/Ned84/OnionSwitch/blob/master/Screenshots/OnionSwitch_GUI3.png)

OnionSwitch will try to connect to an ExitNode in this country. This can take up to max. 10 seconds.
If no exitnode is found it will tell you so, otherwise your chosen country will be added to the list.

### StrictNodes

If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat the ExcludeNodes option as a requirement to follow for all the circuits you generate, even if doing so will break functionality for you. If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will still try to avoid nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the side of avoiding unexpected errors. Specifically, StrictNodes 0 tells Tor that it is okay to use an excluded node when it is necessary to perform relay reachability self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a hidden service to a client, fulfill a .exit request, upload directory information, or download directory information.

Please refer to the Tor manual [here](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en) for more information.

### Tor Metrics

In the menubar under "Help" you will find the option "Tor Metrics".
If you want to search for specific or overall available Exit nodes, click on "Tor Metrics" and it will copy the URL to tor-metrics into your clipboard, so you can open it in the browser of your choice without being forced to connect to the torproject with your normal browser if you dont want to.
