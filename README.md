## Description

Interface to easily switch the Tor-Exit-Node Destination Country in your Tor-Browser.
It is possible to force exit nodes to a specific country, exclude exit node countries and/or exclude countries for every Relay not only the exit relay.

## Manual

Please close the Tor-Browser (if opened) before starting and using OnionSwitch

![OnionSwitch GUI](https://github.com/Ned84/OnionSwitch/blob/master/Screenshots/OnionSwitch_GUI.png)

Choose the path to your Tor-Browser in the Settings (the very first folder in the Tor-Browser structure) as shown below (in Edit -> Settings).
In the Settings its possible to turn off the Stem Node Check which connects to an exit when choosing a country to check if the exit country is available or not. If you experience problems with Stem you can turn it off here.
Its possible to change the timeout presetting for the stem node check between 5 and 60 seconds.
Use a higher presetting if you experience timeouts on exit-nodes that should be available.

![OnionSwitch TorPath](https://github.com/Ned84/OnionSwitch/blob/master/Screenshots/Settings.png)

Node-Country can be chosen in the dropbox or it is possible to write the country code directly into the countrycode-box underneath the dropbox.
Only valid countrycodes work, otherwise the line will get deleted.

![OnionSwitch GUI](https://github.com/Ned84/OnionSwitch/blob/master/Screenshots/OnionSwitch_GUI2.png)

After choosing the country, its possible to add it to the torrc with clicking the button "Choose Node" or "Blacklist" respectively.

![OnionSwitch GUI](https://github.com/Ned84/OnionSwitch/blob/master/Screenshots/OnionSwitch_GUI3.png)

OnionSwitch will try to connect to an ExitNode in this country. This can take up to max. 10 seconds because OnionSwitch will try to connect to the Exitcountry you chose.
If no exitnode is found it will tell you so, otherwise your chosen country will be added to the list.

### StrictNodes

If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat the ExcludeNodes option as a requirement to follow for all the circuits you generate, even if doing so will break functionality for you. If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will still try to avoid nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the side of avoiding unexpected errors. Specifically, StrictNodes 0 tells Tor that it is okay to use an excluded node when it is necessary to perform relay reachability self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a hidden service to a client, fulfill a .exit request, upload directory information, or download directory information.

Please refer to the Tor manual [here](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en) for more information.

### Tor Metrics

In the menubar under "Help" you will find the option "Tor Metrics".
If you want to search for specific or overall available Exit nodes, click on "Tor Metrics" and it will copy the URL to your clipboard, so you can open it in the browser of your choice without being forced to connect to the torproject with your default browser if you dont want to.

### 5 - 9 - 14 Eyes Presettings

It is now possible to block 5 - 9 or 14 Eye Countries via the settings.
Choose the countries you would like to block and simply press ok.
It will add the countries to your "Blacklist all Nodes" list.

### Reset Tor

In the help menu is the "Reset Tor" Menu. If you experience problems with the Tor Browser (not connecting to relais anymore, timeouts etc) you can reset it here back to the state when you first launched the OnionSwitch. Please restart OnionSwitch after reseting.

## Support

If you require help or if you have suggestions please refer to the [Issue section](https://github.com/Ned84/OnionSwitch/issues).

## Verify Signatures

### Windows

Download the sha256sum.txt and the .asc for your OnionSwitch version.

#### Basic checksum verification

In Powershell:

```(Get-FileHash .\OnionSwitch*.*_setup.exe).Hash -eq (Get-Content .\sha256sum.txt).split(" ")[0].ToUpper()```

should show:

```True```

#### Signature verification

The programm is sign with my signature which windows checks when you run OnionSwitch setup.

It should state **"Open Source Developer, Rene Mario Baumgartner"** as Verified Publisher.

### Linux

Download the sha256sum.txt and the .asc for your OnionSwitch version.

#### Basic checksum verification:

```shasum -a 256 -c sha256sum.txt```

should show:

```OnionSwitch_V*.*.tar.xz: OK```

#### GPG verification

```curl https://keybase.io/ned84/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import```

and verify with:

```gpg --verify OnionSwitch_V*.*.tar.xz.asc```

should show:

```Good signature from "Ned84 <ned84@protonmail.com>"```
